Hello programmers! I am Shashank Savarkar, B.Tech student pursuing major in Civil Engineering(Rail Specilazation) from Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya(GSV-Vadodara) formarly known as National Rail and Transporation Institute(NRTI-Vadodara).
So here I've uploaded the source code of the Google Chrome Extension. My 1st extension created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It is a basic "Planner" or we can call it as a "To Do List".
Also, I've attched the working principle of any extension on any browser.
So, that's it from my side. Adios Amigo!!
